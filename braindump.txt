Ace	11 or 1 (The ace is valued @ 11 unless the hand will go over 21, then it's 1)

---{ Rules }---
-> Dealer and player start game w/ 2 cards each
	-> Dealer has 1 card face down in case of black jack

-> A starting hand of a 10 valued card and an Ace is called a Blackjack or natural and 
	beats all hands other than another Blackjack. If both the player and dealer have
	Blackjack, the result is a push (tie): neither the player nor the bank wins and
	the bet is returned to the player.

-> If player and dealer get 21 its a draw

-> Dealer offers 2 cards to player until 
	-> Player decides too stick (stick w/ what you have) or twist (get another card)
	-> If player sticks, dealer gets 2 cards
	-> Player can receive a card till 

-> Go back and forward until dealer has more than 17 or goes bust
	-> If over 17, compare score to player and participant w/ higher score wins
